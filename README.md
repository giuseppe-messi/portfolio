This is my personal portfolio site.

There’s not a ton going on here, just a few clean, visually appealing components and some basic info about me.  
The real action is in the linked GitHub projects, where you’ll find examples of what I actually build: React apps, a design system, and a monorepo full of hands-on demos.

Think of this site as a front door, the rest is in the code.
